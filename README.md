# Attrision-Rate
Companies keep track of its employees performances using attrition rates.

A employee's worth to company is crucial for the profit, therefore several aspects of a employee are provided as features.

In this project you will find extensive EDA, Data cleaning and modeling of dataset.

The core idea was to bring out the most important features of an employee to conclude it's worth, and I have provided feature important for almost all models.
